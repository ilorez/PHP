# WEB DYNAMIQUE

Welcome to Web Dynamique! This repository contains resources to help you learn web development from the ground up. 

Here you will find exercises and small projects that will help you learn the fundamentals of web dynamique including: 
* PHP 
* GET/POST requests 
* Loops 
* Functions

In each exercise or project, you will find instructions on how to complete it and what to do when you're finished. You will also find a link to the solution so you can compare your work. 

We highly recommend that you try to solve the exercises and projects on your own before looking at the solution. This will help you get a better understanding of the concepts and build your own problem solving and debugging skills. 

Good luck, and happy coding!
